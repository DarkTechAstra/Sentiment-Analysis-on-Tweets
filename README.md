# Sentiment Analysis on Tweets using GRU-based Deep Learning Model

This project focuses on building a binary sentiment analysis model using a deep learning approach. The model classifies tweets as either **Positive** or **Negative** based on their textual content.


## üìå Project Overview

The goal is to preprocess raw tweet data, convert it into numerical representations, and train a GRU-based neural network model using TensorFlow & Keras. The project also demonstrates evaluation and validation using various techniques including stratified K-Fold cross-validation.


## üí° Key Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Removing mentions, hashtags, retweet tags, URLs, and special characters.
- **Lemmatization**: Converting words to their base form for better normalization.
- **Text Vectorization**: Tokenization and sequence padding to prepare input data for the neural network.
- **Model Building**: A sequential model built with GRU layers, batch normalization, dropout layers, and dense output for binary classification.
- **Performance Optimization**:
  - EarlyStopping to avoid overfitting.
  - ReduceLROnPlateau to adaptively lower learning rate.
- **Model Evaluation**: Using accuracy, classification reports, and K-Fold cross-validation for robust performance estimation.


## üß† Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **NLTK** for text cleaning & lemmatization
- **TensorFlow / Keras** for deep learning model construction
- **scikit-learn** for evaluation metrics & data splitting


## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run

1. Mount Google Drive and load the dataset:
   ```python
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')
   ```
2. Perform data cleaning & lemmatization to prepare the text.
3. Tokenize the cleaned text and pad sequences to uniform length.
4. Split data into training and testing sets.
5. Build and compile the GRU-based deep learning model.
6. Train the model with early stopping and learning rate scheduling.
7. Evaluate the model on the test set.
8. Perform Stratified K-Fold validation to ensure generalization.

  - K-Fold Cross Validation: Ensures robustness.


## üìä Results

The model demonstrates strong potential for classifying sentiments in real-world tweets, with ongoing improvements to further refine performance.


## üöÄ Future Work

- Hyperparameter tuning
- Experimenting with other architectures like BiLSTM or Transformer-based models.
- Deploying the model as an API for real-time sentiment analysis.


## üìÅ Dataset

The dataset used is a collection of labeled tweets commonly used for sentiment analysis tasks, originally from the Sentiment140 dataset.
